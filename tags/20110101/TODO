- Increase the support for manufacturer logos. Especially in the ic library.
- Create a new global file (e3d_textures.inc) and texture definitions there.
  Then use these texture definitions in the macros instead the direct texturing.
  Advantage: Color changes to the same type of texture can be done on one 
  central point.
- All of the Eagle3D supplied inc files should be prefixed with e3d_.
- Test the build system under windows (cygwin)
- Get rid of the shell scripts in tools/ and do it all with perl
- Get rid of the .inc.src files and create a more modern macro definition
  file format.
- Translate all the comments in the ULP/INC files to english
- Improve the ULP
- Create new macros
