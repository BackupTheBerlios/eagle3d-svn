About Eagle3D
=============

Eagle3D is an application to create raytraced visualizations of PCB
layouts created by Eagle. You can get a free version of Eagle from
www.cadsoft.de

This package is independent from cadsoft.

How to build Eagle3D
====================

There are a couple of scripts in the tools directory. Just cd into
that directory and run the create_eagle_3d.sh shell script and you
should end up with three archives (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .zip).

To get the big overview png with all the macros call the render.sh
script in the tools/ directory.

Extending Eagle3D?
==================

There are not much rules when adding code to the ULP or the POVRay
macros. But please don't use tabs for indention and use four spaces
for indention. If you find parts of the code where these rules are
violated please fix it and send a patch.

There are some more rules regarding macro naming and usage of POVRay statements:

- A base macro always starts with the prefix of the inc file and ends in _GRND.
  So, a new macro in the ic.inc file would be name IC_MY_IC_PACKAGE_GRND. The
  resulting calls of this macros are then called IC_MY_IC_PACKAGE_*.
- The name of the source file is always the name of the base macro extended by
  a .inc.src
- Do not use the #declare statement in your macros as these add identifiers to
  the global scope of POVRay which may collide with other macros. Please use
  #local instead.
- Do not add anything besides your copyright to the pre.pre and pos.pos files
  in the source directories. Currently all things which you would like to be
  some sort of global definition should stay inside a single macro. We will 
  have a global file for such things in the future (see TODO)
  
After adding your macro you can call tools/render.sh after building Eagle3D to
test the successfull integration. The scripts takes an additional parameter so 
that you can only render some of the macros.

$ render.sh IC_SMD_* 

This will result in only rendering macros which start with IC_SMD_.
