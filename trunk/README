About Eagle3D
=============

Eagle3D is an application to create raytraced visualizations of PCB
layouts created by Eagle. You can get a free version of Eagle from
www.cadsoft.de

This package is independent from cadsoft.

How to build Eagle3D
====================

There are a couple of scripts in the tools directory. Just cd into
that directory and run the create_eagle_3d.sh shell script and you
should end up with three archives (.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .zip).

To get the big overview png with all the macros call the render.sh
script in the tools/ directory.

Extending Eagle3D?
==================

There are not much rules when adding code to the ULP or the POVRay
macros. But please don't use tabs for indention and use four spaces
for indention. If you find parts of the code where these rules are
violated please fix it and send a patch.

All other rules (naming, ...) should be clear if you take a look
at the existing macros.
