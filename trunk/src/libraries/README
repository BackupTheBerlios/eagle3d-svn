  These folders hold library files for some of Eagle3D's components.

  These library files were created by:
 MC Cason <farmerboy1967(replace with at)gmail.com>

  Currently only the Ealge-6x library files have been written.  I will be
 adding and updating the files as I get a chance.  Eventually I will get some
 eagle-5x, and earlier library files created, but for now this is all I have. 

  If you have any library files that you would like to submit, you can send
 them to me personally,  It is my hopes, that every component that is listed
 as NOEAGLEPAC, have a library file for it, so that they are readily
 usable, without having to rely on you to create your own files.
