  These folders hold library files for some of Eagle3D's components.

  These library files were created by:
 MC Cason <farmerboy1967(replace with at)gmail.com>

  There are 2 folders:
    Eagle
    Eagle-6x

  I have a few Eagle-6x library files written, and only 1 Ealge-4.1x library
 written.  I will be adding and updating the files as I get a chance.

  Eventually I will get some more library files created, but for now this
 is all I have. 

  If you have any library files that you would like to submit, you can send
 them to me personally,  It is my hopes, that every component that is listed
 as NOEAGLEPAC, have a library file created for it, so that they are readily
 usable, without having to rely on you to create your own files.
